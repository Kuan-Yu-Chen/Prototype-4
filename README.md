Rolling Ball Game

[There is a Demo video which displays the gameplay. Check it out!]

Rule:

     Use left and right arrow keys to control the viewpoint. Use up and down arrow keys to control the player movement.
     When all enemies fall down the stage, enemy number will be increased by 1.
     There are 2 types of powerup. The Yellow one will increase the collision force applying on the enemies.
     The green one will make the player shoot the bullets to each enemy once by pressing space bar respectively.
     All powerups will last for 5 seconds.
